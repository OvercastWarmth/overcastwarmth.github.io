  </header>
  <p>Abbigail has forgotten the last time that she wrote anything. She has
    forgotten the last day that she ate three decent meals in a single day.
    She has forgotten the last time that she managed to get a satisfactory
    amount of chores done.</p>
  <p>She has forgotten the last time that she went a day without having a
    headache after a collision with the wall. Or with her hand. Or with
    something blunt <em>in</em> her hand.</p>
  <p>Her head down on her desk, she wishes that she could cry. She wishes
    that the tears would well up, and that she could just let it all out. It
    feels like it’s not even bad enough if she’s not crying. It feels like
    she’s just being selfish if she’s not crying. It feels awful that she
    can’t cry. She feels worthless, she feels numb, she feels null. She
    doesn’t want to <em>feel</em> anymore. She doesn’t want to die, but she
    just wants. A break. She wants a break. From having to persist. From
    having to exist. From having to hate herself all the time.</p>
  <p>She wishes she was just. <em>Elsewhere</em>.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>The Caretaker is jolted awake. It grumbles. It was having quite a
    nice sleep before it was <em>rudely</em> awoken.</p>
  <p>Though, it guesses its accipients cannot help it. They can’t be aware
    of what is happening to them until it <em>has</em> happened.</p>
  <p>Regardless, it supposes that it should get itself ready. Its rest may
    have been cut short, but it does still feel well rested.</p>
  <p>It pulls open the wardrobe and starts to sift through it.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Abigail has fallen asleep at her computer. She is dreaming. Dreaming
    of a comfortable place. Dreaming of a place where she is cared for, and
    can heal. At least she. Thinks. That’s… what this means. What else could
    the feeling of lying face-down on a sofa in a room <em>just</em> the
    right temperature be?</p>
  <p>She then realises that she knows she’s dreaming. Which is. Not
    normal. Is she lucid dreaming? Why can’t she see anything. Why is the
    smell and the feeling of the blanket over top of her- why is there a
    blanket? Is she awake? Did someone find her and put a blanket over her?
    No, she doesn’t live with anyone, how could that happen. What-</p>
  <p>“Uhm…”</p>
  <p>Abigail jolts up. She’d swear if she wasn’t still so lethargic. She
    can barely comprehend anything.</p>
  <p>In front of her is a figure. They stand tall- no, are they floating
    off the ground slightly? They wear a long robe with pale hair, which
    seems to flow a bit in the… wind? Abigail doesn’t feel any wind, though?
    Why is there wind? Aren’t they indoors?</p>
  <p>The figure in front of her speaks, their voice soft, careful, yet
    strong in her ears and almost ethereal. “Oh, did I wake you up? I’m
    sorry.”</p>
  <p>Abigail tries to ask “Who the fuck are you, where am I?” but she ends
    up stumbling over her words. She still feels so tired. Is she dreaming?
    She was dreaming right? Did she establish that before?</p>
  <p>Surprisingly, she gets a response. “You are, uh.” The figure pauses
    for a moment, before speaking. “You are in <em>Sanctuary</em>.”</p>
  <p>Abigail understands, but something feels. Off. She knows what
    “Sanctuary” is, like she’s known it her whole life. But she doesn’t feel
    like she should. Also, she could have sworn that the woman in her,
    admittedly blurry vision, did <em>not</em> say Sanctuary. The figure
    said something else, Abigail is sure. But it’s like her brain corrected
    it for her?</p>
  <p>“Oh, don’t worry about that right now. You’re far too tired.”</p>
  <p>Yes, right, she <em>is</em> tired. She needs a coffee. She places a
    hand on the side of the sofa to get up, before realising that her hand
    is very close to a very hot mug.</p>
  <p>“Sorry, I didn’t have time to put a cupholder in it so. Just be
    careful. Here, I can help you up if you want.”</p>
  <p>Abigail <em>wants</em> to deny being touched by the weird tall
    floating woman right now but she is too fucking tired to think about
    <em>anything</em> in this situation and she’s dreaming anyway so might
    as well roll with it at this point.
  </p>
  <p>The figure very gently grabs hold of Abigail’s sides and straightens
    her up on the sofa. They’re very gentle when touching her. Abigail
    appreciates that. She’s not quite used to being touched. They hand her
    the drink, and she takes it after <em>attempting to</em> fixing up the
    blankets around her lap.</p>
